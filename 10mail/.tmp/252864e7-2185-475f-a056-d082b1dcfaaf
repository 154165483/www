Dear Friend,</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I am Mr. Frost Gilbert. I am a US</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
citizen, 66 years Old. I reside here in</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Centreville Virginia U.S.A. My</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
residential address is as follows.14852</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Rock Landing Court Centreville Virginia</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
20121 United States and my email address is (mr.garrywise2020@gmail.com) and my telephone number is +1(202)265-8262 you can call me or send me a&nbsp; text</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
message and i will respond back to you.I am one of those that fall victims to scammers in Africa two years ago. I have lost over US$100,000.00 for the</DIV>
<DIV>
past years while in the USA. I was trying to get my payment all to no avail. And they always stopped my funds with one reason or the order. So I decided to</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
travel with my Son to WASHINGTON D.C with all documents, there the (FBI) was amazed and contacted the Nigeria embassy in the USA. After some hours in that</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
office, I was asked by the FBI officer to come back the next week.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
When I did the FBI officer gave me the contact of one Mrs. Maria Farnandez who is a representative of the (FBI) and a member of the compensation award</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
committee, currently in Nigeria. And when I contacted her she explained everything to me. She said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake that I</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
should fly down to Nigeria to see things for myself which I did and she took me to the paying bank for the claim of my</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
compensation payment. This was paid to me successfully. Right now I am the happiest man on earth because I have finally received my compensation funds of US</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
$1,300,000.00. Moreover, Mrs. Maria Farnandez showed me the full Information of those that are yet to receive their compensation funds and this was how came</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
across only your email address and your full name.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
The only Money I paid after I meet with Mrs. Maria Farnandez was just $550.00 (Five Hundred &amp; Fifty Dollars) for the ownership paper works. So I am advising</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
you to contact Mrs. Maria Farnandez through her email address (mrs.lindahill3030@gmail.com) for your own money including the money you lost or you can as</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
well call her on her direct telephone number (+234-8131387018) please take it very serious. Please contact her and send your telephone number and your</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
residential address to her so that she can release your own money to you.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Thank you &amp; God bless you.</DIV>
